Visually design [Keras models for R language](https://keras.rstudio.com/). 

The idea of Keras Model Creator is based on [Deep Learning Studio](
https://deepcognition.ai/features/deep-learning-studio/).

Take a look at the [guided tour!](
https://jcrodriguez.shinyapps.io/KerasModelCreator_dev/?help)

## Features

* Load input matrix.
    - Select percentage of data to use as train and validation.
    - Select input and output columns.

* Add layers and connections manually.

* Set compile options.

* Get automatically generated code.

* Fit your model! And visualize epoch by epoch its metrics.

* Choose the sample dataset and model to try Keras Model Creator.

## Installation

Clone KerasModelCreator repository, i.e., from a bash console:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/jcrodriguez1989/KerasModelCreator.git;
```

Install package dependencies, i.e., from R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c(
  "jsonlite",
  "keras", # not a dependency, but come on!
  "shiny",
  "shinythemes",
  "visNetwork"
));
```

## Usage

From an R console type:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# replace by the PATH where KerasModelCreator was cloned
setwd("KERASMODELCREATOR_PATH");

library("shiny");
# will open the app in a web browser
runApp();
```

Or visit the [example app](https://jcrodriguez.shinyapps.io/KerasModelCreator_dev/)
at shinyapps.io

And take the [guided tour](

## Limitations

* Few network layers already developed.
